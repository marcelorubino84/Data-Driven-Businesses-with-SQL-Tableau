# Data-Driven-Businesses-with-SQL-Tableau

## Project Overview:

* **Eniac** (a fictional company from Spain) is exploring an expansion to the Brazilian market.
* **Eniac** lacks the knowledge of such a market, hence it needs another company with experience in dealing with providers, package delivery service, etc.
* **Magist** is a Brazilian Software as a Service company that offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
* **Eniac** sells through its own e-commerce store in Europe, with its own site and direct providers for all the steps of the supply chain. In Brazil, however, Eniac is considering signing a 3-year contract with Magist and operating through external marketplaces as an intermediate step, while it tests the market, creates brand awareness, and explores the option of opening its own Brazilian marketplace.

There are two main concerns regarding the expansion of Eniac to the Brazilian market:

1. **Eniac’s catalog is 100% tech products, and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories**. It is not clear that the marketplaces Magist works with are a good place for these high-end tech products.

1. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? **Are deliveries fast enough?**

### Scope:

The main purpose of the presentation is to recommend whether or not to sign the deal with Magist.
